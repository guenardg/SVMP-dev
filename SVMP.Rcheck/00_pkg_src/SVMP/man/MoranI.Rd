\description{
Carries out the calculation of Moran's autocorrelation coefficient and test
its significance using Monte-Carlo permutations.
}
\details{
The Moran's autocorrelation coefficient allows one to test the bulk
autocorrelation in a data set. It can be positive, in which case observations
located closer tend to be more similar than random observations drawn
irrespective of the location, or negative, in which case observations located
closer tend to be more dissimilar (or less similar) than random observations
drawn irrespective of the location. In the (somewhat unlikely) situation
where signal components associated with both positive and negative
autocorrelation would be present in a data set, bulk autocorrelation as
quantified by Moran's coefficient may appear small and non-significant in
spite of the presence of a structured signal.

The matrice of connection weights can be a binary matrix of a weighted
matrix obtained from function \code{\link{sp.cov}}.

Options for the permutation test (argument \code{test}) are either "two-tail"
for a two-tail test, "lower-tail" to perform a single-tail test under the
alternate hypothesis that the coefficient is smaller (more negative) than
the value expected for the null hypothesis, "upper-tail" to perform a
single-tail test under the alternate hypothesis that the coefficient is
larger (more positive) than the value expected for the null hypothesis, or
"none" to perform no permutation test; only returning the value of the
coefficient without testing information.

Optionally, the permuted coefficient values can be returned, allowing one to
plot the frequency distribution of the coefficient under the null hypothesis
of the absence of autocorrelation.
