# R Package SVMP-dev: Spatial Variance Modeling and Prediction -- Development

Documents herein contains the development files and R implementations of a
framework for spatial variance modeling and prediction. It involves a
distance-based variance operator that can be used to calculate spatial covariances.
These covariances are then used as a Laplace operator to obtain en eigensystem whose
eigenvectors represent a suite of spatial variation patterns (eigenvalues represent
the sizes of the structures). Besides a Euclidean space, the method can be applied
to any manifolds, for instances geodesics using great circle distances on spheroids
or ellipsoids, or curves surface using shortest path lengths as distances between
locations.

The R language package called SVMP-dev that is included herein is for research
purposes and should be expected to change over time. It is an unpublished and
unrevised work that has been put here for informational purposes only. Therefore,
it must not be relied upon for application until the method and implementation
it be duly revised and published.
