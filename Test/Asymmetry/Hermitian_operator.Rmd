# Introduction

## Rationales

Natural processes that operate in time are generally directed as they often
cannot be reversed. For instances, erosion cannot reverse to generate mountains
decomposing leaves can't be reversed to life leaves, bush fires can't be reverted
back to grasslands, and so on. Also, natural processes that operate in space
may do so in a directed manner. For examples, seeds may disperse more readily
down dominant winds, river fish may prefer locations some distance downstream of
tributaries carrying drifting preys on which they can feed, parasite may more
readily transfer from one area to another than the other way around because of
spatiotemporal patterns in migrations. It is not particularly hard to imaging
all sorts of situation where time, space, or space-time interactions would occur
in directed fashions to influence natural variability. Have a way to describe
that variability and its directed nature would thus be a valuable asset to
ecology, evolutionary science, and other disciplines that are concerned with the
dispersal for organisms or genes in space and time.

## Fourier transforms

Fourier transforms is, perhaps, the most common approach to time series
analysis. It consists in representing the time series as a set of basis
functions that are the sum of a cosine and a sine as follows:
$$\psi_k(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j e^{-\frac{i2\pi}{N}kj}$$
where $k=0,1,2,...,N-1$ is the order of the transform and $j$ is the index of
each of the $N$ discrete observations $x_j$ in the time series ($e$ and $\pi$
are the usual constants and $i$, the imaginary unit solving the equation
$i^2 + 1 = 0$). Because the exponential of an imaginary number corresponds to a
sum of a cosine and a sine ($e^{ia} = \cos(a) + i \sin(a)$), $\psi_k(x)$ can
also be represented as follows:
$$\psi_k(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j \left[\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}kj \right)-i \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}kj \right)\right]$$
and thus each components of the transform correspond to the combination of a
cosine whose amplitude corresponds to the real part of $\psi_k(x)$, which we
will hereafter refer to as $\mathrm{Re}(\psi_k(x))$, and a sine whose amplitude
corresponds to the imaginary part of $\psi_k(x)$, and which we will hereafter
refer to as $\mathrm{Im}(\psi_k(x))$. The inverse of that transform is obtained
by the following:
$$x_j(\psi) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \psi_k e^{\frac{i2\pi}{N}kj}$$
which corresponds to superposing each an every cosine and sine combinations as
follows:
$$x_j(\psi) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \psi_k \left[\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}kj \right)+i \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}kj \right)\right]$$
Special considerations arise as $x_j$ are all real values. When $k=0$, the
cosine is a constant $1$ and the sine a constant $0$ irrespective of $j$, and
thus $\psi_0$ is the sum of all $x_j$. Moreover, coefficients with $k>0$ are
conjugate symmetric (i.e.,
$\psi_l=\mathrm{Conj}(\psi_{N-l})$ for $l=1,2,...,N-1$), which is expected as
pairs of end to end coefficients have to cancel out one another's imaginary part
to yield real numbers.

Fourier transforms are applicable to time series analysis, where time steps are
homegeneous in duration. They cannot be used for data set resulting from
sampling a phenomenon at irregular time intervals. Fourier transforms are
applicable to two-dimensional data sets (i.e., regularly-sampled grids), but
